uniCMS was created due to necessity of creation and design of a new protal 
for the University of Calabria. After evaluation of several 
options, University of Calabria having a strong in-house competitive 
and highly skilled technical team it was decided to opt for the development 
of a brand new CMS solution based on Django framework.
