# uniCMS

uniCMS is a Web Content Management System built on top of **Django Framework**, wrote by 
young IT guys that think that a nowadays CMS should be:

- Loaded with a ready to use Template:
    - Mobile ready
    - SEO convenient
    - Bootstrap compliant
    - Pluggable as a Django application
- Highly oriented to a logic of content reuse, entries can be reused - or only in pieces - in different contexts, as you like and with many strategies
- **OpenAPIv3** (OAS3) compliant
- Able to use many RDBMS engines, agile schema migrations as Django wonderfully does
- **Multi Web Site** management
- **MongoDB FullText Search** engine with management commands (CLI)
- Able to **localize its entries in many languages**
- Able to handle Editorial Board workflows (WiP) and permissions by contexts
- Able to handle huge loads, Cached approach based on Redis TTL
- Secure by default
- Scalable
- Pluggable, interoperable

uniCMS is intended for both end users 
and smart developers, creating a website with uniCMS does not require any development skills.

uniCMS was born as a result of the need to renew the web portal of the 
University of Calabria, after taking a look at the offer of free and open CMS 
and strong of our experience, we decided to develop it with Django and equip it **with batteries** as well.
