Welcome to uniCMS's documentation!
==================================

This project aims to exemplify the design of a common University Web Portal.
You'll find a simplified generalization of all
the entities that usually make up a Content Management System (CMS).

This platform was built on top of Django Framework, with few specialized libraries as well.
The final goal is to achieve as much as possible, writing as 
little code as possible and working even less, when possibile.
